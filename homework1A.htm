<h1>CIS 128 - Mobile Web App Development </h1>

<img src="susanpic.jpg" alt="susansfamilypic.JPG" style="float:left;width:120px;height:172px;">

<p>My education and prior work life was in business.  I have a B.S. in Economics from Santa Clara University and an M.B.A. in Finance & International Business from New York University.  I've worked in finance and marketing for Aetna, Nestle and Oral-B as well as completed two year with a litigation consulting firm in New York and San Francisco.  After leaving the corporate world I developed an interest in the health and fitness field.  Over the years I've been trained in and taught yoga (200 hour certification), pilates (500 hour certification) and, most recently, indoor cycling and TRX (resistance training).  Volunteering is another big part of my life.  I've been deeply involved with Girl Scouts over the past 11 years and am a troop leader as well as manager of recruiting and new leader mentoring in Redwood City. This summer I will be taking my younger daughter's troop to Switzerland to visit a world scouting center.  The girls have been fundraising for 3 years in support of this trip.  If you want to buy Girl Scout cookies, I can definitely hook you up!</p>



<p class="div1">This class is my third from the CIS department at CSM.  A friend inspired me when she took a few accounting classes to brush up on her skills. She introduced me to the wonderful community college system.   My coursework began in the Digital Media department with classes in Illustrator and Typography.  From there I decided to investigate what it takes to make an app.  I've taken 111 Intro to Web Programming and 254 Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (Java).  128 will bring me closer to understanding the pieces of app development.  Next semester I would like to try the iOS/Swift Programming class to learn the tools to create a basic native app.  I think it's important to keep learning and challenging ourselves as we age!</p>
